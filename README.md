# AirBnB Clone Project

This is a project to create a clone of AirBnB. The first step of this project is to build a command interpreter to manage our AirBnB objects, which include aspects such as Users, Places, Reviews etc.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python3

### Installing

Clone this repository to your machine:

```bash
git clone https://<GitToken>@github.com/JD037/holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone.git

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a shell-like command-line interface where you can manipulate and manage your AirBnB objects.

### How to start it
To start the command interpreter, navigate to the root directory of the repository and run:

./console.py

### How to use it
The console supports various commands for managing AirBnB objects:

create: Creates a new object.
show: Displays the string representation of an object.
destroy: Deletes an object.
all: Displays all instances of a class.
update: Updates an object.

Example:

    (hbnb) create User
    (hbnb) show User <id>
    (hbnb) destroy User <id>
    (hbnb) all
    (hbnb) update User <id> 'name' 'John Doe'
