# AirBnB Clone Project
 
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python3

### Installing

Clone this repository to your machine:

```bash
git clone https://<GitToken>@github.com/JD037/holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone.git

## Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a shell-like command-line interface where you can manipulate and manage your AirBnB objects.

Advantages of JSON:
It stores all the data in an array so that data transfer makes easier. 
Its syntax is very small, easy, and light-weighted thatâ€™s the reason it executes and responds in a faster way.
It has a wide range for browser support compatibility with the operating systems.


### How to start it
To start the command interpreter, navigate to the root directory of the repository and run:

./console.py

### How to use it
The console supports various commands for managing AirBnB objects:

create: Creates a new object.
show: Displays the string representation of an object.
destroy: Deletes an object.
all: Displays all instances of a class.
update: Updates an object.

Example:

    (hbnb) create User
    (hbnb) show User <id>
    (hbnb) destroy User <id>
    (hbnb) all
    (hbnb) update User <id> 'name' 'John Doe'
